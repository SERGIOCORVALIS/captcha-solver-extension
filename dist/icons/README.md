# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using:
1. Design tools (Figma, Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop)
2. Online icon generators
3. Image editing software

## Icon Design Suggestions

- Use a simple, recognizable symbol (e.g., "CS" for CAPTCHA Solver)
- Use a blue color scheme (#3b82f6) to match the extension theme
- Ensure icons are clear and readable at small sizes
- Use transparent background (PNG format)

## Quick Icon Creation

For testing purposes, you can create simple colored squares with text using any image editor:

1. Create a new image with the required size
2. Fill with blue background (#3b82f6)
3. Add white text "CS" in the center
4. Export as PNG

For production, use professional icon design tools.
